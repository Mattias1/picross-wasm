      <h1>Picross tutorial</h1>
      <p>
        Here's a tutorial on how to solve a simple picross puzzle with some stripes, have fun!
      </p>

      <!-- An empty example puzzle -->
      <div class="row p-like">
        <div><img src="tutorial-0.png" alt="An empty picross puzzle"></div>
        <div>
          <p>
            To the left you see an example of a picross puzzle. The numbers tell you how many
            consecutive squares in the row or column should be coloured.<br>
            For example, the bottom row has a 3 and a 1. That means that three consecutive squares
            need to be coloured, then there needs to be some empty space, and then one more square is
            coloured.<br>
            Since there are in total five squares to fill, there's only one way to do that:
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="tutorial-0-1.png" alt="The bottom row"><br>
            This means we have solved our first row, hooray!
          </p>
          <p>
            Most puzzles don't have a row where you can colour all squares right away, so let's look
            at a slightly modified version of this puzzle to make it a bit more interesting.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- The tutorial puzzle - the first row -->
      <div class="row p-like">
        <div><img src="tutorial-1.png" alt="A slightly modified empty picross puzzle"></div>
        <div>
          <p>
            If we look at a row with a 4, there are two possibilities: it can be the 4 squares on
            the right, or on the left. In both cases the middle 3 squares are filled, so we can
            colour them already and wait for later revelations to see if the right or the left
            square should be coloured.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="tutorial-1-1.png" alt="A row with a 4"><br>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- The tutorial puzzle - the column -->
      <div class="row p-like">
        <div><img src="tutorial-2.png" alt="The result so far"></div>
        <div>
          <p>
            If you've added information to a row, it often makes sense to check if that gives you
            more information for affected columns.
          </p>
          <p>
            The affected column with a 3 for example now has one less possibility. Because of that, we
            now know one square that can be coloured.<br>
            Also, we know that the top square can never be coloured, so we can mark it as empty.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="tutorial-2-1.png" alt="A row with a 4">
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- The tutorial puzzle - the last row -->
      <div class="row p-like">
        <div><img src="tutorial-3.png" alt="The column with a 3 where we know a coloured square"></div>
        <div>
          <p>
            We just added information to a column so let's look at the corresponding row.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the left of the square that we know has to be empty, there is not enough space for 2
            squares. That means the 2 squares have to be on its right. That leaves two possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="tutorial-3-1.png" alt="A row with a 2 where we know a square to be empty"><br>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- The tutorial puzzle - for you to finish -->
      <div class="row p-like">

            And that's the basics of how to solve a picross puzzle.

            You can complete the puzzle over here to the right
            (click to colour a square black, Ctrl-click one to mark it as empty),
            or you can try some of my <a href="http://localhost:8000">other puzzles</a>.
