Picross wasm
=============
A little picross app I made to play with WebAssembly and Rust.

Dev setup
----------
Install the tools as described in <https://dev.to/dandyvica/wasm-in-rust-without-nodejs-2e0c>.
Then compile and run with `./run.sh` (make sure it's executable).
It runs at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
